# Soil Health Monitoring System

This project aims to implement NPK sensor, PH sensor and soil temperature and moisture sensor to analyze the minerals present in the soil and suggest the best crop to be planted to give the best results. To be precise, measure the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, pH level, temperature and moisture of the given soil sample and display the measured outputs to the farmer. This whole system works even when the internet is unavailable and stores the data.
